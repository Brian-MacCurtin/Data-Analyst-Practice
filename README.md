# Project Overview
This project takes a deeper look at job postings for data analyst roles across the globe in 2023. Using four different datasets that contain information about the job postings, the project focused on trying to find the best jobs in the data analyst world and also the trends of what is required for different jobs. This includes looking at **highest-paying** skills and the **most in demand** skills.

## Dataset
The data from the jobs postings was split into four different datasets: job_postings_fact, skills_job_dim, skills_dim, and company_dim

Information about the names and types of variables, as well as the relationship between each dataset can be found below:

# Project Goal
This project was designed to teach me the basics of setting up a database, using SQL queries to accsess it, and how to format the results from those queries.

I learned how to manipulate datasets to return the results I wanted and I also learned how to join together multiple datasets to display different inforation across the different data sets

Please find the queries I used for the project here: [SQL Data Analytics Project](/SQL%20Data%20Analytics%20Project/)

# Research Questions

1. What are the **top-paying** jobs for a data analyst?

2. What are the **skills** required for the **top paying** data analyst jobs?

3. What are the most **in demand skills** for a data analyst?

4. Which data analyst **skills** are associated with the **highest salaries**?

5. What are the **optimal skills** to learn for a data analyst? What skills are both in demand **AND** high paying?
